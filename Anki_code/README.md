Only use this folder if you need to make Anki flashcards. The main analysis of this work is done under **frequency_list** and **text_transform**

---
To use this folder, I have included some example Anki dictionaries to get started, as well as an existing deck of a few cards. Go to the [dictionary maker](Anki_code\anki_dictionary_maker.py), after you have collected the data from **..\frequency_list\Anki_verb_conjug_scraper.py**.

Then create the deck with the [Anki deck maker](Anki_code\anki_deck_maker.py).
